# Udacity FEND project: Arcade Game

Fourth project in the Google-Udacity Scholarship 2018 (built with Vanilla JS).

## How it works

The main goal is to reach the water with your avatar, and collect as many gems as you can.

When the game starts, you can choose an avatar. There are three images, and you can select the avatar with a click on it. After the selection process, the game page will appear, and you can start hunting the gems.

You can move your player with the arrows on your keyboard.

At the top of the game, you can see three hearts, these represent the life you have in the game. You can see there also the number of gems you have collected, and the points you have (1 gem = 250 points, reach the river = 500 points).

- If the player runs into a bug one heart will disappear, and the player goes back to the starting point.

- 5 gems = 1 heart, so if you lost a heart, but you have more than 5 gems, the hearts will refill.  

- When the player losts all of the hearts, the game is over. You can choose to play again, and in this case, you can see your earlier results.
